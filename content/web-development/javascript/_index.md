## JavaScript Overview

Javascript is a high-level, dynamically typed and interpreted, programming
language that was created in May of 1995 by Netscape employee Brendan Eich.

The language was famously created in only 10 days and adopted the name Javascript
as a marketing play, playing off the hugly popular Java programming language.
Although ironically the two languages are very different.

Javascript was built with the sole purpose of making websites more responsive and
dynamic. Because it's able to respond to user interactions and access and manipulate
the document object model (DOM), Javascript allows web developers to make
more dynamic websites.

In 1996 the early version of Javascript was adopted into a formal language specification
called ECMAScript, of which Javascript was the most well known implementation.
By specifying the language formally, all browsers could support languages implementing
ECMAScript. So Technically Javascript is based off the ECMAScript specification.

### How JavaScript Runs

Today Javascript is a staple, used on just about every modern website. It's become
one of the three core web development technologies along-side HTML and CSS.

Because javascript is a core web development technology and most web developers
know it, Javascript has been stretched beyond it's original purpose. Now-a-day's
there are thousands of javascript frameworks and it's even used as a server-side
language.

Javascript utilizes a garbage collector and it's syntax is loosly based on C/C++.

### Choosing an IDE

Many developers choose to write Javascript using a basic text editor, generally
Javascript will be written in the same enviornment as the HTML and front end technologies
that it interacts with. In many cases javascript will be written directly inside
of an HTML file, but can also be palced in it's own separate Javascript file and
imported into HTML.
