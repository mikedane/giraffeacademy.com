          echo "He was $characterAge years old <br>";

          $characterAge = 80;

          echo "He really liked the name $characterName <br>";
          echo "But didn't like being $characterAge <br>";
    d: |+
          Names are case-sensitive and must start with '$' then:
            letters, _
          After, may include
            letters, numbers, _
          Convention says
            There is no set convention, people will use camel case but also underscores
            ex. myFirstVariable
            ex. my_first_variable
