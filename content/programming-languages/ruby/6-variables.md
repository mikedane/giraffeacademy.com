          character_age = 80

          puts "He really liked the name " + character_name
          puts "But didn't like being " + character_age
    d: |+
          Names are case-sensitive and may begin with:
              letters, _
          After, may include
              letters, numbers, _
          Convention says
              Start with a lowercase word, then additional words are lowercase separated
              by an underscore
              ex. my_first_variable
