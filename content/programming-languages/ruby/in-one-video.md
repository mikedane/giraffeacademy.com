## Ruby Overview

Ruby is a general purpose, dynamically typed and reflective, object
oriented programming language that was created in the 1990s by
Yukihiro Matsumoto.

The original intent when creating ruby was to create a true Object Oriented
scripting language. Which at the time, in Matsumoto's optinion, didn't exist.
Ruby was designed to be simple at it's core, but with an object
system that was fully integreated into the language, and not tacked on as a
glorified addon.

At the core of ruby is the desire for programmer productivity and fun. Ruby's
core focus is on the programmer not the machine. Therefore ruby attempts to
remove as much confusion as possible from the programming process by utilizing
a simple, readable syntax and deeply integrated object orientation.

### How Ruby Runs

Generally all ruby code is run using an interpreter, although with some
implementations of ruby it is possible to compile the code and run it on a
virtual machine.

The most popular ruby interpreter is called MRI which stands for
Matz's Ruby Interpreter. Unfortunatly there is no official Ruby Language Reference,
so generally the Matz interpreter is seen as the language standard.

Ruby utilizes a garbage collector and it's syntax is very minimal and simple.

One reason Ruby has become so popular is due to the Ruby on Rails web application
framework. Rails is extremely easy to use which is why it's the framework of
choice for tons of large companies like Github, Twitch and Hulu.

### Choosing an IDE

Many developers choose to write Ruby using a basic text editor, but there are also
more specilized integrated development enviornments, some of the most popular
include RubyMine, Aptana RadRails and Vim.

## Code

### Printing
{{< code lang="ruby" >}}
puts "Hello"
print "World"
puts "!"
{{< /code >}}

### Variables and Data Types
{{< code lang="ruby" >}}
=begin
 Names are case-sensitive and may begin with:
     letters, _
 After, may include
     letters, numbers, _
 Convention says
     Start with a lowercase word, then additional words are lowercase separated
     by an underscore
     ex. my_first_variable
=end
name = "Mike"     # Strings
age = 30          # Integer
gpa = 3.5         # Decimal
is_tall = true    # Boolean -> True/False

name = "John"

puts "Your name is #{name}"
puts "Your name is " + name
{{< /code >}}

### Casting and Converting
{{< code lang="ruby" >}}
puts  3.14.to_i
puts  3.to_f
puts "3.0".to_s

puts 100 + "50".to_i
puts  100 + "50.99".to_f
{{< /code >}}

### Strings
{{< code lang="ruby" >}}
greeting = "Hello"
#indexes:   01234

puts greeting.length
puts greeting[0]
puts greeting.include? "llo"
puts greeting.include? "z"
puts greeting[1,3]
{{< /code >}}

### Numbers
{{< code lang="ruby" >}}
puts  2 * 3         # Basic Arithmetic: +, -, /, *
puts  2**3          # Exponent
puts  10 % 3        # Modulus Op. : returns remainder of 10/3
puts  1 + 2 * 3     # order of operations
puts 10 / 3.0       # int's and doubles


num = 10
num += 100          # +=, -=, /=, *=
puts num

num = -36.8
puts  num.abs()
puts  num.round()

# Math class has useful math methods
puts Math.sqrt(144)
puts Math.log(0)
{{< /code >}}

### User Input
{{< code lang="ruby" >}}
puts "Enter your name: "
name = gets                             #.chomp
puts "Hello #{name}, how are you"

puts "Enter first num: "
num1 = gets.chomp
puts "enter second num: "
num2 = gets.chomp
puts num1.to_f + num2.to_f
{{< /code >}}

### Arrays
{{< code lang="ruby" >}}
lucky_numbers = [4, 8, "fifteen", 16, 23, 42.0]
#       indexes  0  1       2      3   4   5

lucky_numbers[0] = 90
puts lucky_numbers[0]
puts lucky_numbers[1]
puts lucky_numbers[-1]

puts "\n\n"
puts lucky_numbers[2,3]
puts "\n\n"
puts lucky_numbers[2..4]
puts "\n\n"

puts lucky_numbers.length
{{< /code >}}

### 2 Dimensional Arrays
{{< code lang="ruby" >}}
number_grid = [[],[]]
# numberGrid = [ [1, 2], [3, 4] ]
number_grid[0][0] = 99

puts number_grid[0][0]
puts number_grid[0][1]
{{< /code >}}

### Array Methods
{{< code lang="ruby" >}}
friends = []
friends.push("Oscar")
friends.push("Angela")
friends.push("Kevin")

# friends.pop
puts  friends
puts "\n"

puts friends.reverse
puts "\n"

puts friends.sort
puts "\n"

puts  friends.include? "Oscar"
{{< /code >}}

### Methods
{{< code lang="ruby" >}}
def add_numbers(num1, num2=99)
     return num1 + num2
end

sum = add_numbers(4, 3)
puts sum
{{< /code >}}

### If Statements
{{< code lang="ruby" >}}

if is_student and is_smart
	puts "You are a student"
elsif is_student and !is_smart
	puts "You are not a smart student"
else
	puts "You are not a student and not smart"
end

# >, <, >=, <=, !=, ==, String.equals()
if 1 > 3
	puts "number comparison was true"
end

if "a" > "b"
     puts "string comparison was true"
end
{{< /code >}}

### Switch Statements
{{< code lang="ruby" >}}
my_grade = "A"
case my_grade
     when "A"
		puts "You Pass"
     when "F"
     	puts "You fail"
     else
     	puts "Invalid grade"
end
{{< /code >}}
