          character_age = "80"

          print("He really liked the name " + character_name)
          print("But didn't like being " + character_age)
    d: |+
          Names are case-sensitive and may begin with:
            letters, $, _
          After, may include
            letters, numbers, $, _
          Convention says
            Start with a lowercase word, then additional words are separated
            by underscores
            ex. my_first_variable
