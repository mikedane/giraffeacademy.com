          System.out.println("There once was a man named " + characterName);
          System.out.println("He was " + characterAge + " years old");

          characterAge = 80;

          System.out.println("He really liked the name " + characterName);
          System.out.println("But didn't like being " + characterAge);
    d: |+
          Names are case-sensitive and may begin with:
                letters, $, _
          After, may include
              letters, numbers, $, _
          Convention says
              Start with a lowercase word, then additional words are capitalized
              ex. myFirstVariable
