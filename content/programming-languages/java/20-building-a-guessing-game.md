Scanner keyboardInput = new Scanner(System.in);

String secretWord = "giraffe";
String guess = "";
int guessCount = 0;
int guessLimit = 3;
boolean outOfGuesses = false;

while(!guess.equals(secretWord) && !outOfGuesses){
     if(guessCount < guessLimit){
          System.out.print("Enter a guess: ");
          guess = keyboardInput.nextLine();
          guessCount++;
     } else {
