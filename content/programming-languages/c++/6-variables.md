          cout << "There once was a man named George";
          cout << "He was 70 years old";
          cout << "He really liked the name George";
          cout << "But didn't like being 70";

          cout << "There once was a man named " << characterName << endl;
          cout << "He was " << characterAge << " years old" << endl;
          cout << "He really liked the name " << characterName << endl;
          cout << "But didn't like being " << characterAge << endl;
    c: |+
          string characterName = "George";
          int characterAge = 70;

          cout << "There once was a man named " << characterName << endl;
          cout << "He was " << characterAge << " years old" << endl;

          characterAge = 80;

          cout << "He really liked the name " << characterName << endl;
          cout << "But didn't like being " << characterAge << endl;
    d: |+
          Names are case-sensitive and may begin with:
              letters, _
          After, may include
              letters, numbers, _
          Convention says
              Start with a lowercase word, then additional words are capitalized
              ex. myFirstVariable
