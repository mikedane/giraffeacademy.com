## Code

{{< code lang="cpp" >}}
bool isStudent = false;
bool isSmart = false;

if(isStudent && isSmart){
     cout << "You are a student" << endl;
} else if(isStudent && !isSmart){
     cout << "You are not a smart student" << endl;
} else {
     cout << "You are not a student and not smart" << endl;
}
