## C Overview

C is a general purpose, staticly typed, imperative programming language
that was founded in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson at Bell Labrotories.

C is a low level language meaning it provides constructs which map efficiently to
typical machine instructions. Baiscally it's a more user friendly way to write
low level programs. Instead of pulling your hair out writing low level code in an
assembly language, you can abstract a lot of the fuss and write equivalent programs
in c

Because it's so low level, many operating system kernals, and even other programming
languages are implemented at least in part, using C. And many modern progrmaming
languages today borrow syntax and best practices from C.

### How C Runs

All c programs must utilize a compiler who's job is to compile the c code down
into machine code readable by the computer. So anytime you want to run a c program
you have to compile it first.

C relies on the  user to manage the program's memory, and the
syntax of C is largly influenced by the B programming language.

## Choosing an IDE

Many developers choose to write C using a basic text editor, but there are also
more specilized integrated development enviornments, some of the most popular
include Code Blocks, Eclipse and Net Beans.
