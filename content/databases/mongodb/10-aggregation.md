          {product: "toothbrush", total: 4.75, customer: "Mike"},
     ]
)

// find out how many toothbrushes were sold
db.purchase_orders.count({product: "toothbrush"})

// Find list of all products sold
db.purchase_orders.distinct("product")

// Find the total amount of money spent by each customer
